# Salaam P3

P3 is network of Additive Manufacturing Service, allowing makers to build stuff wherever, whenever. Just upload the file and specify stuff, rest we'll handle.

## P3 v0.0.1

Initial Version of P3, would be just be basic suggestion of additive manufacturing service provider that filters out the venders based on the cost and process.
In upcoming verision v0.0.2, we're planning to add more varriables to based on filter and better UI.

## P3 v0.0.2

Based on P3 v0.0.1, basic suggestion of additive manufacturing service provider continues to filters the venders based on the cost and process, and added location based sorting to suggest closest service provider, reducing cost of delivery/pick up. Further, now users can switch between different color themes.

## P3 v0.0.3

Long awaited feature is here, now users could suggest for 3D printers (CNC AM). Currently, only FDM is supported though in future version more additive manufacturing processes would be included. Version 0.0.3 would soon also have a guide to navigate the UI of P3.

# Contribute and Feedback

You can also contribute to the developement of P3 either by algorithms for filter and suggestions, client and/or cloud side GCode generator and Guide for Building the additive manufacturing services.
